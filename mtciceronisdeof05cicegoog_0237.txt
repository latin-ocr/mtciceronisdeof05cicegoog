the more, if you can obtain greater benefit when the
affliir is successfully accomplished, than injury, if it
be attended with danger.'’ An illustration ofCicero’s
meaning may be found in the lise of Alexander the
Great. When that monarch was so severely iudis-
posed that his physicians dared not give him any
medicine, because they thought themselves not so
certain of the cure as os the danger they must incur
in the application, Philip, the Aean-nanim, attempted
the cure. Alexander took the remedies offered, al·
though he had been advised in a letter from Parmenio
“to beware of Philip, whom Darius had prevailed
upon to take him off by poison,” thinking it better
to trust a physician of doubtful saith than to perish
by an undoubted malady. The result showed that

his opinion was correct.
